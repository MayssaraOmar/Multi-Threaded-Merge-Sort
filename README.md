# Multi-Threaded-Merge-Sort

Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:<br />a)If the list is of length 0 or 1, then it is already sorted. Otherwise:<br />b)Divide the unsorted list into two sub-lists of about half the size.<br />c)Sort each sub-list recursively by re-applying the merge sort.<br />d)Merge the two sub-lists back into one sorted list.<br />The multi-threaded merge sort is implemented using Pthreads.<br />Each time the list is divided; two  threads  are  created  to  do  merge-sort  on  each  half  separately. This  step  is repeated recursively until each sub-list has only one element.
